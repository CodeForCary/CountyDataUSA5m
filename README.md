# CountyDataUSA5m
5m resolution from Census.gov - GeoJSON file of all counties in the USA

Grabbed data from Census.gov: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_counties.html
This is a 2017 set, 5m resolution level - all county boundaries in the USA.
Went to mapshaper.org and coverted this to GeoJSON and sharing here.
